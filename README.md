A stylish Zsh theme with deliberate use of space. Single file. No dependencies. Highly customizable.

<br>


## Features
### Separator Line
The namesake of the prompt, a line above the information with matching colors. May be disabled with `HL_SEP_MODE=off` for a more compact prompt.

### Information Line
`<user> @ <host> (<venv>): <path> | <branch> [<status>]`

This line collapses to fit within the terminal width. Individually style each segment of the information line using [ANSI SGR codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#SGR_(Select_Graphic_Rendition)_parameters) (which are conveniently aliased in the theme file). You can customize nearly everything about the segments and even add your own.

### Git Status
A segment with symbols describing the status of the current Git repository.

| Symbol | Meaning          |
|--------|------------------|
| `+`    | Staged changes   |
| `!`    | Unstaged changes |
| `?`    | Untracked files  |
| `↓`    | Commits behind   |
| `↑`    | Commits ahead    |
| `↕`    | Commits diverged |
| `*`    | Stashed files    |
| `✘`    | Conflicts        |
| (none) | Clean branch     |

## Customization

The `headline.zsh-theme` file describes variables ([around line 60](headline.zsh-theme#L60)) for customizing prompt behavior, colors, styles, symbols, etc. You can edit the theme file directly or set these variables in your `~/.zshrc` *after* sourcing the theme to override the defaults. There are plenty of options so play around and make it your own!

More details in **[Customization](docs/Customization.md)**

## Terminal Setup
For the continuous line above the prompt, use a font with ligatures such as [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). Alternatively, use the "lower 1/8th block" character instead of underscores with `HL_SEP[_LINE]='▁'`.

If you want symbols, use a font that has them such as [FiraCode Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode) and include your desired symbols in `HL_CONTENT_TEMPLATE`.
