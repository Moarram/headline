Headline. A stylish theme with deliberate use of space. No dependencies. Easily customizable.

<br>


## Features
### Separator Line
A line above the prompt info text with matching colors. May be disabled with `HEADLINE_LINE_MODE=off` for a more compact prompt.

### Information Line
`<user> @ <host>: <path> | <branch> [<status>]`

This line collapses to fit within the terminal width. Individually style each segment of the information line using [ANSI SGR codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#SGR_(Select_Graphic_Rendition)_parameters) (which are conveniently aliased in the theme file). You can customize the characters for joining segments and disable segments entirely.

### Git Status
All the Git status symbols are customizable. The defaults are below:

| Symbol | Meaning          |
|--------|------------------|
| `+`    | staged changes   |
| `!`    | unstaged changes |
| `?`    | untracked files  |
| `↓`    | commits behind   |
| `↑`    | commits ahead    |
| `↕`    | commits diverged |
| `*`    | stashed files    |
| `✘`    | conflicts        |
| (none) | clean branch     |

### *Exit Code*
`→ <code> (<meaning>)`

When enabled with `HEADLINE_DO_ERR=true`, print non-zero exit codes ahead of the prompt. The exit code meaning is merely a guess for the semi-standard exit codes (in the range 126-143) and is often incorrect.

### *Clock*
When enabled with `HEADLINE_DO_CLOCK=true`, display the time to the right of the prompt.

## Customization
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moarram/headline/assets/images/configs.gif" width="600"/>

The `headline.zsh-theme` file describes variables ([around line 70](headline.zsh-theme#L70)) for customizing prompt behavior, colors, styles, symbols, etc. You can edit the theme file directly or set these variables in your `~/.zshrc` *after* sourcing the theme to override the defaults. Play around with it and make it your own!

More details in [Customization](docs/Customization.md)

## Terminal Setup
For the continuous line above the prompt, use a font with ligatures such as [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).

If you want symbols, use a font that has them such as [FiraCode Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode) and assign your desired symbols to the prefix variables.
